# Personal Projects

Here are a few side projects I've done that demonstrate my coding experiences:

## Overhang
A small python script I wrote which can be run in Blender 2.79. By stacking blocks on top of each other, each hanging a bit over the one beneath it, it is theoretically possible to get as much overhang as we want, assuming we can use as many blocks as we want (See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block-stacking_problem). I wanted to put this to the test using a physics simulation in blender, so I wrote this script to stack the blocks in precisely the right place. This made it easy to test it on any number of blocks I wanted and to see how many I could use before it fell over due to the physics not being mathematically perfect.

## ImageOpener
A java application I made to generate and view images in a file format not used by any other program. I wanted to make a program to make images that could only be viewed by my friends who had the program. I had to learn a little bit of Java GUI programming as well as image processing / file IO in order to get it to work. This was also my first experience trying to share a java program with my friends who don't code, and that was a learning experience in itself.

## PlantDatabase
I made this as a personal project because I wanted to keep track of my plants in Pokemon. It's not something super useful but I did use my knowledge of java collections in it so I felt pretty satisfied with the result. I stored the plants by making the collection serializable and writing it to a file.

## gmatool
This is a fork of an open source command line tool found at https://github.com/Mechalico/gmatool. The original purpose of the tool is to extract 3d models from the proprietary .gma and .tpl files used by certain gamecube games. I used this tool for game modding, but there were some bugs in it, so I made a fork of the tool in order to fix these bugs as well as to clean up the code a bit, and I also added a feature to make it easier to use. Even though I haven't really learned C++, I was able to figure out what the code did and fix it based on my knowledge of Java and C.

## Phonebook
I worked on this web app over the summer of 2020 because I wanted to learn a bit of website development so I could work on my college radio station's website, wmuc.umd.edu, which is in need of an update. The code is based on the exercises from this online course: https://fullstackopen.com/en/, and I got through part 3. A functioning version of my app is actually available at https://pacific-dawn-62176.herokuapp.com/. I used MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js to make it. I felt like I learned a lot about web development working on this tutorial, though there is still a lot I don't know.
